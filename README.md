# EMail-Application
The email application is designed to send email(s) against a spreadsheet of users and their files associated with them. Ultimate goal is to automate a deployment system/application that will deploy reports to the respective stakeholder and the day of the week the stakholder is requesting the report.

Within this you'll find the spreadsheet that is used to house the listing of emails, file paths of the report you wish to attach and the day you wish to deploy it.
